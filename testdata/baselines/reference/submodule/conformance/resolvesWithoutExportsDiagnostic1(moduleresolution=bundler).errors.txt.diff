 /index.mts(1,21): error TS7016: Could not find a declaration file for module 'foo'. '/node_modules/foo/index.mjs' implicitly has an 'any' type.
   There are types at '/node_modules/foo/index.d.ts', but this result could not be resolved when respecting package.json "exports". The 'foo' library may need to update its package.json or typings.
